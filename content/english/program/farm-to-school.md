Our Farm to School program serves students fresh, locally sourced ingredients in school meals, fresh local fruits and vegetables on our salad bar, and local grass fed beef and organic chicken in our main dishes.

YES has a greenhouse, a garden, and a henhouse, all tended by the YES farmer and students. We buy food produced by local farmers and ranchers and we scratch cook school meals in our school kitchen.
