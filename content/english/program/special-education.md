## EVE DOMINGO â€“ S.E. DIRECTOR
Ms. Domingo began a career in teaching in 1993. She worked as a substitute teacher for Kindergarten through 12th grade, an after school director and a First grade teacher. When her son was born, she decided to work from home. During that time she established an organic fruit and vegetable farm with her husband.

Although she loved working outdoors and growing beautiful fruits and vegetables, she found herself longing to work with students again. Ms. Domingo became the Special Education teacher at YES Charter Academy in the fall of 2017.

Since then, she has been thrilled to be a part of a school with a strong focus on science and the environment and part of a team of teachers that deeply care about the well being and academic success of their students.
