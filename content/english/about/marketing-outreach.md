YES seeks to ensure that our student population is representative of the population in our surrounding areas.

We actively seek to recruit students to our school from our service area and from contiguous counties. Our population is primarily drawn from the surrounding Yuba County foothills communities of Browns Valley, Oregon House, Dobbins, and Brownsville.

Our school population closely matches that of Dobbins Elementary school in that we draw from the same general population.
Our recruitment efforts have included the following:

To date we have 

- mailed postcards out to 6 postal zip codes
- We have constructed new signage and placed them at different locations in our surrounding community.
- We have had made brochures
- Radio advertisement
- Internet advertising
