Yuba Environmental Science (YES) Charter Academy has served TKK through 8th Grade students in the North Yuba watershed since 2008. Now YES has a plan to add high school grades. YES HS graduates will be college and career ready. 

Students will graduate with college prep, a-g requirements completed, as well as earning certifications in three Career Technical Education (CTE) pathways: 
- (1) Forestry and Natural Resources
- (2) Entrepreneurship
- (3) Design, Visual, and Media Arts. 

School programs of study emphasize project based learning around solving authentic environmental issues.
