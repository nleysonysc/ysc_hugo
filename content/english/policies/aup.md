Information for Students and Parents

The Yuba Environmental Science Charter Academy (“YES Charter Academy”) Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) is to prevent unauthorized access and other unlawful activities by users online, prevent unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive information, and to comply with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (“CIPA”).  As used in this policy, “user” includes anyone using the computers, Internet, email, chat rooms and other forms of direct electronic communications or equipment provided by YES Charter Academy (the “network”).  **Only current students or employees are authorized to use the network.**

YES Charter Academy will use technology protection measures to block or filter, to the extent practicable, access of visual depictions that _are obscene, pornographic, and harmful to minors_ over the network.  YES Charter Academy reserves the right to monitor users’ online activities and to access, review, copy, and store or delete any electronic communication or files and disclose them to others as it deems necessary.  Users should have no expectation of privacy regarding their use of YES Charter Academy property, network, and/or Internet access or files, including email.
