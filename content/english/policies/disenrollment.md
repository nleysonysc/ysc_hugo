When a student leaves YES Charter Academy we perform the following procedures:

- Make sure all books and technology are returned
- We watch for a Transfer of Student Records request. If we do not receive one we will follow up with the parent/guardian to see where the child has transferred to. We will then contact the school directly to confirm.
- If we are unable to make contact with the parent/guardian regarding the students’ new enrollment we will then contact the SARB department as they will need to be involved.
- Upon receiving a request for Transfer of Student Records, the student’s cumulative records will then transferred to the new school.

Once the disenrollment process is complete they will be removed from our student records database.
