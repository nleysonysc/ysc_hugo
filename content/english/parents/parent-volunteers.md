## Get Involved With Your Child's Education
Each parent of an enrolled child at YES Charter Academy is invited to contribute four (4) hours per trimester (twelve (12) hours per year) of volunteer time to support the activities and students of YES Charter Academy. This commitment is for twelve (12) hours, per year, per family, not per child. 


Please check the list below for some of the events going on this school year. We need help for all of them!
